# Image Caption Generator - Flickr Dataset



# Project Information

This project is to predict the captions from an  image. The dataset consists of 8k images and 5 captions for each image. The features are extracted from both the image and the text captions for input. The features will be concatenated to predict the next word of the caption. CNN is used for image and LSTM is used for text. BLEU Score is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
